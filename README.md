# gostructures
Data Structures written in Golang.

**NOTE: If you want to run the tests, make sure you are using Go 1.9, as the `t.Helper()` function is used.**

Current list of structures:
* [arraylist](/arraylist) is a storage mechanism which uses a slice to store multiple values, although hides all of the shifting.
* [linkedlist](/linkedlist) is a list which uses links nodes to each other in order to store multiple values.
* Coming soon
  * Maps (with custom hashes and equality)
  * Sets
  * Heaps
  * Trees (redblack, AVL, etc)
  * Stacks
  * Queues
  * Deques
  * Set up examples for documentation
